# Python_Chat_Bot

This project implements a chatbot system using Python that provides detailed information about a university, including facilities, fee structures, academic programs, and extracurricular activities. The chatbot utilizes a pattern-matching technique to interpret user messages and respond with relevant predefined information. Key features of the project include:

User Message Processing: The mess_prob function calculates the probability that a user message matches predefined response categories based on recognized words and required words.
Response Selection: The check_all_messages function evaluates the user message against various response categories and selects the best match with the highest probability.
Information Categories: The chatbot covers multiple informational categories, including hostel fees, scholarships, university overview, admission process, campus details, student-faculty ratio, collaborations, student clubs, sports facilities, branch change procedures, available courses, placement statistics, top recruiting companies, faculty information, extracurricular activities, fee structure, infrastructure, library, transport fees, medical facilities, and specific B.Tech courses.
Unknown Responses: The chatbot includes a function to handle unrecognized queries by providing random responses from a predefined list.
Interactive Testing: A loop allows continuous user interaction with the chatbot, providing an ongoing dialogue until the user decides to exit.
The project is designed to serve as a comprehensive informational resource for prospective students, current students, and other stakeholders, facilitating easy access to essential information about the university. The system is modular and easily extensible, allowing for the inclusion of additional information and features as needed.
